- have an early console also for serial (uart8250 in assembly, yuck)
- the kernel parameters are in boot.asm hard-coded, cannot be passed
  from outside
- test more A20 switching stuff on real hardware
- better detection of swapped disks (but do we want a special sector
  with disk 2 of 5? This is much harder to create)
- test other floppy sizes
